# Injection Molded Face Shield Frame

This is a remix of the frame from here: https://github.com/mrjonny2/PNWS. It has only a few minor changes, designed to make
it easier to injection mold the entire frame.

* The head band is thicker to make it easier to fill
* The head band is symetric between the mold halves (the original design was not to ease 3D printing)
* It has 3 degrees of draft everyone except for where the face band touches you forehead
* The molds can be cut with 1/16" end mills for faster production of molds (no EDM required)

The original design is by the Washington State 3D Face Shield Hub on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/209781503693623/

The mold was made by Payton Dean from https://bricktactical.com/, and he is
also makign the frames on his Boy 22S injection molding machine.

This frame is best used with the "origami" shield developed by the PNWS group:

The image below uses a prototype that I made using my injection molding machines (that are too small to make the entire frame).
